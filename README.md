# Cholo_Ride-Sharing-App
This project is a Ride Sharing Management System built as part of our CSE370 Database Systems course. It allows BRAC University students to create, join, and manage shared vehicle trips efficiently. The system maintains secure user profiles, allows trip rating, and supports recurring trip scheduling.
